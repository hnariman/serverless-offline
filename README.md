# serverless-offline
example of microservices based on serverless framework

Sample microservice based application, to test out local development of AWS Lambdas / Serverless framework.
Hence local development is relatively harmless for stage data and might improve development time.

## TODO:
- DynamoDB (native AWS)
- MongoDB (best in class IMHO NoSQL)
- SQS (AWS job query service)
- SNS (messaging & delivery)
- ApiGateway (better to test it with SQS instead of API Gateway, but still need to test it)
